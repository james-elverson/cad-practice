# CAD & Simulation Practice

This repository contains mechanical CAD and basic simulation projects created
to practice parametric design, engineering documentation, and introductory
analysis.

The projects mainly focus on vehicle and powertrain-style components and emphasize:
- Fully constrained, parametric CAD models
- Export to industry-standard formats (STEP)
- Engineering drawings generated using FreeCAD TechDraw

This work is for educational and portfolio purposes.
